## TL;DR

Transformation encompasses the adaptation of an organisationâ€™s value proposition and business & operational model 
to the fundamental changes brought by global trends both economical and societal, digital technologies and increasingly 
demanding stakeholders needs and expectations.

Innovations: a new idea or method, or the use of new ideas and methods.
